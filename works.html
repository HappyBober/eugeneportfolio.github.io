          <p>I love making videos. Over the years I have engaged in a wide range of media endeavors, including crafting short films, documentaries, music videos, interviews, educational content, and podcasts.</p>
          <h2>Video Showreel 2023</h2>
            <p>This video includes the highlights of my work.</p>

        <h2>2023</h2>
        <h3>Sleep Tight</h3>
        <p>Working with Familiar Shadows Entertainment was a pleasure of mine. As a Sound Editor, I have crafted the audio narrative from scratch and used my audio library to include original music in the film. </p>

        <h2>2022</h2>
        <h3>Nottingham Refugee Week </h3>
        <p>Nottingham Refugee Week is an annual cultural festival that celebrates the culture of sanctuary people have built in Nottingham. Delivered through a fabulous programme of events organised in partnership with refugee and asylum-seeking communities, it is an act of welcome, a gesture of solidarity, and a shared celebration with people who have sought refuge in the UK. Later on, the documentary was shown at Broadway Cinema in Nottingham.</p>

        <h3>The Ritual</h3>  
        <p>Had an opportunity to work as a Cinematographer and lead the camera crew. Creating the look of the film was an interesting challenge for me and also a great experience to work closely with the director discussing the film and interpreting his words into visuals.</p>

        <h3>My Favourite Artist</h3>
        <p>My directorial debut — a film centered around an undiscovered artist named Lisa, who grapples with social anxiety and struggles to connect with others. Nevertheless, her late boyfriend makes an attempt from the beyond to guide her on a journey toward personal growth and moving forward.</p>

        <h3>EMAS (East Midlands Ambulance Service)</h3>
        <p>In collaboration with NHS Midlands, I took on the role of a producer, where my responsibilities included creating educational videos for NHS employees. I efficiently managed production logs, scouted suitable filming locations, handled actor hiring, and crafted compelling pitches to meet the requirements of our client.</p>

        <h3>Angels & Airwaves – Hallucinations (Reimagined)</h3>
        <p>Music production and storytelling through music have always intrigued me. I make it a daily practice to listen to various genres of music, constantly seeking inspiration for song ideas. In one of my recent music videos, I crafted a compelling point-of-view (POV) narrative, portraying a guy's emotional journey as he spends a night with the girl he deeply loves.</p>

        <h3>Plan International UK</h3>
        <p>I had the privilege of collaborating with Plan International as a videographer and video editor, creating captivating promotional content. These videos were strategically shared on digital platforms like YouTube, reaching and engaging Pathway students all across the UK.</p>

        <h2>2021</h2>
        <h3>Frontliners: Above and Beyond</h3>
        <p>During the global pandemic, when people were confined to their homes, I had the idea of making a documentary focused on the courageous efforts of social workers who continued to serve during those challenging times while the rest of us stayed at home. Coordinating the filming team presented a significant challenge, as we were all scattered in different locations. Nevertheless, our dedication paid off, and the documentary was submitted to the Critical Awards in Television Awards 2021 and shortlisted among the top 10 entries.</p>

        <h2>2020</h2>
        <h3>Nottingham Festival Science and Curiosity</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the global pandemic, I had the opportunity to work as a videographer and video editor for Ignite Futures. I collaborated with them on the Wollaton Watch project, which was part of the Nottingham Festival of Science and Curiosity. This project involved creating a series of educational videos aimed at inspiring children to engage with the wonders of science. The videos were streamed online through platforms like Facebook (Meta), YouTube, Twitch, and Notts TV, reaching a wide audience of over 40.000 thousand people. </p>

        <h3>The Good Night Story</h3>

        <h2>2019</h2>
        <h3>Bonds</h3>
        <p>While pursuing my studies at the university, I embarked on my creative journey by producing my very first film. It was a remarkable experience that marked the beginning of my filmmaking endeavors. Taking on multiple roles, I independently crafted the script, recruited actors, handled filming, and videoeditng. The outcome of my efforts was recognized and celebrated when I was honored with the Best Director Award at NTIC.</p>
