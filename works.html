          <p>I love making videos. Over the years  I have engaged in a wide range of media endeavors, including crafting short films, documentaries, music videos, interviews, educational content, and podcasts.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 2022, I was involved in filming Nottingham Refugee Week. It aims for people to get to know asylum seekers that arrived to find another home.</p>

        <h3>EMAS (East Midlands Ambulance Service)</h3>
        <p>I worked with NHS Midlands creating educational videos for NHS workers. I was responsible for conducting production logs, looking for locations to film, hiring actors, and pitch-creating for our client.<p>

        <h3>Angels & Airwaves – Hallucinations (Reimagined)</h3>
        <p>I was always interested in music production and how to tell stories using music. I listen to music every day and always try to come up with ideas for songs I hear. In this music video, I made a POV of a guy who spends a night with a girl whom he loves.<p>

        <h2>2021</h2>
        <h3>Frontliners: Above and Beyond</h3>
        <p>During the global pandemic when everyone was sitting at home, I had an idea to create a short documentary about social workers who worked during those terrifying times while everyone stayed at home. It was a challenge to coordinate the team to film as we all were far away from each other. The documentary was sent to Critical Awards in Television Awards 2021 and was shortlisted in the last 10.</p>

        <h2>2020</h2>
        <h3>Nottingham Festival Science and Curiosity</h3>
        <p>During the lockdown, I was afraid that I will not be able to find a job in media, however, I found an internship as a videographer at Ignite Futures. They were working on the Wollaton Watch project for Nottingham Festival Science and Curiosity – a series of educational videos to encourage children to be involved with science. The project was streamed online on Facebook (Meta) and YouTube platforms and Notts TV.</p>

        <h3>Bonds</h3>
        <p>The first film I produced while studying at the university. It was my first experience where I began my creative journey. I single-handedly wrote the script, found actors, filmed, and edited the film. Later, I received the Best Director Award at NTIC.</p>
